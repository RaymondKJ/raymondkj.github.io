abstract: This study examines the effect of social capital on the incidence of genuine
  overeducation among employees in mainland China. Utilising unbalanced panel data
  from the 2012â€“2018 China Labor-force Dynamics Survey (CLDS) and employing an instrumental
  variable (IV) approach, we find that social capital has a significant negative effect
  on genuine overeducationâ€”a dual mismatch of schooling and skills with occupational
  requirements. This impact remains robust across various tests. Further analysis
  shows that social capital primarily improves skill allocation rather than educational
  matching, with social networks and trust serving as the main driving components.
  Mechanism analysis suggests this effect is driven by an information channel, which
  outweighs a statistically weak favouritism channel. Additionally, the benefits of
  social capital are more pronounced for vulnerable groups facing greater information
  barriers. Our findings underscore the importance of social capital in improving
  labour market outcomes in developing countries.
